# Gess

Welcome to the game of Gess! This is a little project I created in May of 2020 using Python to play an abstract board game called Gess. 
Initially, the program was meant to satisfy the final project requirements for my CS 162 course, Introduction to 
Computer Science II. However, I completed the program early and had some fun designing a front end for it using Pygame.

Please see the game rules for Gess [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/gess.html). 

My favorite aspect about this project was the transformation of the game board. The course requirements limited
the tools I could use, thus my first iteration of the game board used ASCII escape sequences seen here:

I'm new to programming and had never used Pygame before, but I read the documentation and after a few iterations I created this 
beauty (refresh the page as needed to see the game in action):

If you would like to play Gess, you will need to install Python 3.6+ for the terminal version and Pygame for the GUI 
version.

**Please install the latest version of Python:**

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


**To install PyGame:**
```
python3 -m pip install pygame
```
If you have trouble installing PyGame, please visit PyGame's [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) page.

Thank you so much for visiting my project and happy gaming!
